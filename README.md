# OS-161
## A Harvard OS built on C and MIPS
### NEW SYSCALLS AND FEATURES ADDED



1. These tools (gmp, mpfr, libmpc, and ncurses) are needed for GCC and GDB installation. On rpm systems such as CentOS, you can run this command as root
# yum install gmp-devel mpfr-devel libmpc-devel ncurses-devel 

2. On dpkg systems such as Ubuntu, you can run this command as root
# apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev libncurses-dev

3. Run the following two commands for the installation of tools and kernel
# cd {path-to-your-oslight}; ./install-tools.sh
# cd {path-to-your-oslight}; ./install-os161.sh

3. After the installation of tools and kernel, create a sample sys161.conf configration file
# cd ${HOME}/os161/root/
# cp {path-to-your-sys161-2.0.8}/sys161.conf.sample sys161.conf

4. You may look into sys161.conf for possible modification. The default is fine for now.

5. Create two disk files of 5MB each
# disk161 create LHD0.img 5M
# disk161 create LHD1.img 5M

6. start this command from one shell
# cd ${HOME}/os161/root/;  sys161 -w kernel

7. Run os161-gdb from another shell
# cd ${HOME}/os161/root/;  os161-gdb kernel

8. Type the following command to attach to the kernel
# target remote unix:.sockets/gdb
